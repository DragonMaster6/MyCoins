# MyCoins - A Coin Collector's App to Track Treasure
This is a project dedicated to keep track of the coins I have collected over the years since I was little. It also serves as a sandbox to learn new web frameworks. With that in mind, this app won't necessarily be production ready as there will be a lot of messy code due to battles with the learning curve.

## Folder Structure
Each folder is name with the backend and frontend framework used to create the application.
### 1. Android
* This project was started back in 2012 when learning the Android Framework while working alongside another project. Sadly the other project didn't pan out and this was left in the dust.
### 2. Laravel-VueJs
* This is an attempt to resurrect the dead Android project by learning the many ways of web development through the Laravel PHP Framework and the UI builder Vue.js.
